# LWJGE
My LightWeight Java Game Engine is a simple, work-in-progress, 2d engine with current support for simple graphics and complete (though slightly convoluted) keyboard and mouse input. The LWJGL dependencies are included and you can find built versions in the jar folder. This project was written in IntelliJ Idea, so if you want to use the source code with Eclipse you may have to figure out dependecies by yourself.
